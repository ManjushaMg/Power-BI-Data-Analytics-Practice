steps:
Calculated Columns: 

● Create a Calculated Column for 'Category Type': Add a calculated column in the Order Details table that combines the 'Category' and 'Sub-Category' columns into a 
single 'Category Type' column.  
● Calculate Revenue per Order in Order Details Table: Create a calculated column in 
the Order Details table to compute the revenue (Amount * Quantity) per order. 
● Create a Calculated Column to Categorize Sales: Add a calculated column named 
‘Sales Category’ in the Order Details table that categorizes each order as 'Above 
Average' or 'Below  Average' based on the Amount value. 

Calculated Measures: 

● Calculate Order Count: Define a measure to count the total number of orders in the 
Order Details table. 
● Calculate Average Profit in Delhi: Create a measure to calculate the average profit for 
orders placed in Delhi. 
● Calculate Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales: Define a measure to calculate the total sales 
amount accumulated from the earliest order date up to each order date. 

Data Visualization: 

Sales Target Achievement by Category: Compare actual sales with sales targets by category using a clustered column chart. 
Max Profit Margin by Sub-Category: Analyze the maximum profit margin for each sub-category of products using a donut chart. 
Monthly Sales Trend: Show the trend of monthly sales over time using a line chart. 
Comparison of Profit and Quantity by Sub-Category: Compare the relationship between profit and quantity sold for different sub-categories using a scatter chart. 
Comparison of Total Sales Amount and Target: Create cards to succinctly display the total sales amount alongside the sales target for quick comparison and analysis. Also, create a 
multi-row card to display the minimum target for each segment. 

Sales Performance Matrix: Build a matrix view to analyze how actual sales compare to sales targets across different categories and months. 

Geographic Sales Analysis: Visualize total sales on a map by city to identify regional sales patterns. 

Sales Distribution by Sub-Category: Represent the sales distribution across different sub-categories using a treemap. 

Order Count Analysis by State: Create a funnel chart to visualize the distribution of order counts across different states.
